        <h1>How to play: Dice Roll GameðŸŽ®</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Dice Roll Game! This exciting game is a twist on the
          classic dice game, where your strategy and luck will determine your
          success. The goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of
          100 points.
        </p>

        <h1>Gameplay Overview:</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The game is played between two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
          </li>

          <li>
            Player 1 starts the game. To begin their turn, they need to click on
            the "Roll Dice" button.
          </li>

          <li>
            When the "Roll Dice" button is clicked, a virtual dice will be
            rolled, and a number between 1 and 6 will be generated. This number
            represents the points earned during that roll.
          </li>

          <li>
            After each roll, the points earned are added to the player's current
            score. The current score starts at 0 at the beginning of the turn.
          </li>

          <li>
            Player 1 can choose to roll the dice multiple times during their
            turn by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The points from each roll
            will be added to the current score.
          </li>

          <li>
            However, if a roll results in the number 1, the player's current
            score will be reset to 0, and it becomes Player 2's turn. So, be
            cautious and strategic with your rolls!
          </li>

          <li>
            To secure the points earned in their current turn, Player 1 can
            click the "Hold" button. The current score will be added to their
            total score, and it becomes Player 2's turn.
          </li>

          <li>
            Player 2 follows the same rules as Player 1, rolling the dice to
            accumulate points or choosing to hold to secure their points.
          </li>

          <li>
            The game continues to alternate between Player 1 and Player 2 until
            one of the players reaches a total score of 100 or more.
          </li>
        </ol>
